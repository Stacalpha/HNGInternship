    <h2>PROJECTS</h2>
      <h3>
        Sky Stream (Open-source project)
        2018 - Present
      </h3>
        <em>
          Many beautiful media players have been created on mobile platforms offering a 
          refreshing look along with their core functionality. I created Sky Stream to bring 
          this same experience to the major desktop operating systems.
        </em>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Developed a cross-platform desktop app for playing media files with JavaScript and 
            Node.js along with HTML and CSS by leveraging the Electron.js framework to use web APIs and 
            features in a native desktop environment.
          </li> 
          <li>
            Used CSS Flexbox extensively to create a flexible layout that remains 
            accessible regardless of how the window is resized.
          </li>
          <li>
            Used the Node.js FS module to fetch media files in a user’s local storage, 
            while using Recursion to handle deeply nested folders.
          </li>
          <li>
            Consumed a REST API to fetch media files from a user’s cloud storage 
            by using the Google Drive API‘s Node.js client.
          </li>
          <li>
            Used JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and render dynamic content 
            fetched from both local and cloud storage.
          </li>
        </ul>
